# Emoji Detector

## Overview
The **Emoji Detector** is a deep learning project aimed at accurately identifying emojis within chat messages. It utilizes a custom AI model optimized for recognizing emojis in message text, structured as a **Python module** with a **REST API**.

## Features
- **Custom CNN Training:** The model is trained on labeled emoji datasets.
- **High Accuracy Detection:** Aims for **99.99% accuracy** in production.
- **Dockerized Solution:** Runs as a containerized service.
- **Structured JSON Output:** Extracts text, timestamps, and emojis from images.
- **No APIs Required:** Fully open-source implementation.
- **Real-time Processing:** Detects emojis in messages instantly.
- **Easy Integration:** Can be embedded into chat applications, social media platforms, and customer support tools.

## System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows / macOS / Linux
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Libraries:**
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch
  - OpenCV
  - Flask / FastAPI
  - Tesseract OCR (for text extraction)
  - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data analysis and visualization)
- **Additional Tools:** Docker (for containerized deployment)

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muteeurrehman28/emoji-detector-ai.git
cd emoji-detector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Running Locally
To run the project locally, execute:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start a local server for detecting emojis in images.

### Running with Docker
```bash
docker build -t emoji-detector .
docker run -p 5000:5000 emoji-detector
```

### Running with a Virtual Environment
If you prefer using a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## API Endpoints
### Upload Image for Emoji Detection
**Endpoint:** `/detect`
**Method:** `POST`
**Input:** Image file
**Output:**
```json
{
  "message": "Hello ðŸ˜Š",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:34:56Z",
  "emojis": ["ðŸ˜Š"]
}
```

### Extract Text and Emojis from Image
**Endpoint:** `/extract`
**Method:** `POST`
**Input:** Image file
**Output:**
```json
{
  "text": "Hey! ðŸ˜ƒ What's up?",
  "emojis": ["ðŸ˜ƒ"]
}
```

## Training the Model
To train the emoji detection model, run:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 300000 --dataset /path/to/data
```
This will train the deep learning model on the provided dataset for 300,000 epochs.

## Deployment
The trained model can be deployed on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure. You can also deploy it on a private server using Nginx and Gunicorn:
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 main:app
```

## Development Roadmap
- **Milestone 1:** 99% accuracy for text, timestamps, and emoji detection.
- **Milestone 2:** Model self-learning and accuracy improvement.
- **Milestone 3:** Integration with frontend for image uploads.
- **Milestone 4:** Support for animated emojis and GIFs.
