## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muteeurrehman28/emoji-detector-ai.git
cd emoji-detector-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

### ▶️ Run Locally

```bash
python main.py
```

This launches a local server at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 🐳 Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t emoji-detector .
docker run -p 5000:5000 emoji-detector
```

### 🧿 Run with Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### 🔍 `/detect` – Emoji Detection from Image

* **Method:** `POST`
* **Input:** Image file (chat screenshot)
* **Output:**

```json
{
  "message": "Hello 😊",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:34:56Z",
  "emojis": ["😊"]
}
```

### 🧾 `/extract` – Full Text + Emoji Extraction

* **Method:** `POST`
* **Input:** Image file
* **Output:**

```json
{
  "text": "Hey! 😃 What's up?",
  "emojis": ["😃"]
}
```

## 🧠 Model Training

To train the custom emoji detection model:

```bash
python train.py --epochs 300000 --dataset /path/to/data
```

> ⚠️ This process is resource-intensive and may take time based on your hardware.

---

## ☁️ Deployment

Deploy the model easily to cloud services or your own infrastructure:

### 🌐 With Gunicorn & Nginx

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 main:app
```

You can reverse proxy this with Nginx for production readiness.

### ☁️ Cloud Compatibility

* AWS EC2 / ECS
* Google Cloud Run / Compute
* Microsoft Azure App Service / VMs

---

## 📅 Development Roadmap

* ✅ **Milestone 1:** 99% emoji/text/timestamp accuracy
* 🔄 **Milestone 2:** Self-improving feedback loop for accuracy tuning
* 🖼️ **Milestone 3:** Drag-n-drop frontend image upload UI
* 🎞️ **Milestone 4:** Support for animated emojis and GIF parsing
